when running commands, AI should consider the context of the project, including folder structure, file contents, and existing code patterns. This will help ensure that generated code is relevant and consistent with the rest of the project.

never again do this 
cd 'c:\Users\God\'s d greatest\Desktop\tfn-web'; npm install zego-express-engine-webrtc
cd "c:\Users\God's d greatest\Desktop\tfn-web" && npm install zego-express-engine-webrtc

instead do this
npm install zego-express-engine-webrtc
npm run dev

always one caommand after the other

do not run "npm run dev"
